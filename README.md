# Loan-default-and-Rating-

In this project work, we use logistic regression technique to find the probability of default(PD) for loan applicant at a bank, after obtaining their probability, we also rate the clients according to their probability of default.            
                      
* In this model, we use Colliearity to select statistically significant Featues and then perform Logistic regression on it                
# ======================================
* Exploratory analysis

* balance the response variable
* Logistic Regression          
* Credit rating for client
